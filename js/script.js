// We ask the user to give us a word then we need to create a function to see if it is palindrome

// then the user choose odd or even and give us a number between 1 and 5.
// we generate a random number (always between 1 a 5) with another function.
// we sum the two numbers
// we need to check if the sum is odd or even with a function.
// then we print who the winner is.
